Welcome to AlphaRotate's documentation!
===================================

**AlphaRotate** is an open-source Tensorflow benchmark for performing scalable rotation detection on various datasets, which is maintained by `Xue Yang <https://yangxue0827.github.io/>`_ with Shanghai Jiao Tong University supervised by Prof. `Junchi Yan <http://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn>`_.

This repository is developed for the following purposes:

* **Providing modules** for developing rotation detection algorithms to facilitate future research.
* **Providing implementation** of state-of-the-art rotation detection methods.
* **Benchmarking** existing rotation detection algorithms under different dataset & experiment settings, for the purpose of fair comparison.
